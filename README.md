# Rain prediction in Austrailia
# Weather Dataset Analysis using Machine Learning

This repository contains code for analyzing a weather-related dataset using machine learning techniques. The analysis involves various steps including data loading, preprocessing, visualization, modeling, evaluation, and feature importance analysis. Below is a breakdown of the code:

## 1. Data Loading and Initial Exploration

I imported libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and NumPy to work with the dataset. The main dataset, named 'Weather_Data.csv', was loaded into a Pandas DataFrame. To understand the data, I displayed the first few rows of the DataFrame using `df.head()` and checked data types and non-null counts using `df.info()`.

## 2. Data Transformation and Visualization

For effective analysis, I converted the 'Date' column into a datetime format using `df['Date'] = df['Date'].astype('datetime64[ns]')`. To visually explore relationships between features and the target variable, I created line plots and various Seaborn visualizations.

## 3. Data Preprocessing

Categorical variables were converted into numeric form using label encoding from Scikit-learn.

## 4. Data Balancing and Outlier Removal

To address class imbalance, I performed upsampling of the minority class. Additionally, I removed outliers using the Z-score method and obtained a cleaned dataset named 'data_clean'.

## 5. Feature Selection and Model Training

The data was split into training and testing sets using Scikit-learn's `train_test_split` function. Multiple machine learning models were trained, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree.

## 6. Model Evaluation and Visualization

Each model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall, Jaccard score, and log loss. Confusion matrices were visualized to gain insights into the models' predictions.

## 7. Feature Importance Analysis

Feature importance was calculated using the Decision Tree model. The results were presented in a DataFrame, and a bar plot was created to showcase the top 10 important features.

This repository provides a comprehensive example of a machine learning pipeline for weather data analysis. Keep in mind that the success of the analysis depends on the quality of the data, the relevance of the features, and the appropriateness of the chosen models for the specific problem.
